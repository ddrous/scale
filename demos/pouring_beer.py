SPH Simulation of Beer Pouring: "Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications", Matthias MÃ¼ller, David Charypar, and Markus Gross, SCA 2003


Steps for simulation

1. Import geometry from usda file
2. Create arrays for position, velocity, and forces
3. Define all kernels
3. Add particles from source
4. In the timesteppiong loop, find neighbourhood information
5. Calculate densities, pressures, 
6. Advect the particles and their velocities
7. check for collision and enforce boundary conditions
8. Export to OpenVDB file
